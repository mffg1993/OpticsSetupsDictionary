# OpticsSetupsDictionary — Optics Figure Library for the Wolfram Language

Publication-ready optics diagrams built in the Wolfram Language (Mathematica): lenses, mirrors, beamsplitters, waveplates, apertures, gratings, detectors, and beam glyphs you can parametrize and assemble into full experimental setups.

## Why
I found myself redrawing the same optics blocks for papers, slides, and lab notes. This library turns those into reusable, parametric components so figures are consistent, editable, and export cleanly (PDF/SVG).

## Features
- Parametric **components**: lenses, mirrors, BS cubes/plates, waveplates, apertures, detectors
- **Beams & polarization** glyphs (rays, Gaussian beams, polarization markers)
- **Composable**: assemble complete setups with positions/sizes/labels
- **Export-ready**: vector output (PDF/SVG) with readable fonts/line weights
- **WL-native**: simple Graphics primitives; works in notebooks & scripts
